## question-book
A simple [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) app for creating, asking, and answering questions.
Designed so you see everyone else's answers only *after* you answer
which helps to avoid initial bias. See [Anchoring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring).

Try it now using [play with docker](http://labs.play-with-docker.com/)

Login, and add a new instance,
in the terminal type these three commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/JonJagger/question-book.git
./question-book/local_pipe.sh
```

![play with docker](/img/play-with-docker.png)

A port 3638 link will then appear near the top of the page. Click it!
